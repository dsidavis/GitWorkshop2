How to deal with the error
```
fatal: cannot do a partial commit during a merge.
```

Let's see if we can reproduce it.

This probably comes from a merge conflict.
So let's create a branch, add some commits
and the merge in such a way that we get a conflict.
Or more specifically that we get 2 or more conflicts in 
2 or more files.

We'll create 2 files - A and B
and edit those.
